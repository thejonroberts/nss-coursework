Notes:

Programming is basically:
-setting values
-iterating over collections (array, object)
-evaluating conditions (operators - ===, >, <, boolean)

Data Types - 
Primitive
	-string
	-number
	-boolean
	-undefined - value of var that is not yet initialized
	-null - intentional 
		(sometimes used in var declarations - if used later and still null, it didn't work.)
	-symnbol (***weirdness. worry about this later.  too zen)
Object

== - truthy - compares values with type coercion
=== - "2" != 2 - compares value and data type

Object
key: value
var person = {
	name: "Joe",
	sayName: function(){return "Joe"}

}

person.name returns "Joe"
person.sayName() returns "Joe" (unrelated to above, just how it is defined)

function sayHello() {
	return "Bonjour"
}

sayHello();

METHOD: value of an object whose definition is a function. as sayName here.
